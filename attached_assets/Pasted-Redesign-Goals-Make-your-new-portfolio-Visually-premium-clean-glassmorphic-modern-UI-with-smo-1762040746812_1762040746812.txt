Redesign Goals

Make your new portfolio:

Visually premium → clean, glassmorphic, modern UI with smooth gradients and 3D feel.

Interactive & animated → elegant transitions powered by Framer Motion (no over-animation).

Dynamic & scalable → easy to add new projects, blogs, testimonials, and integrations.

Connected to your platforms → Fiverr, Upwork, Contra, LinkedIn, etc.

SEO optimized with metadata and structured data for personal branding.
