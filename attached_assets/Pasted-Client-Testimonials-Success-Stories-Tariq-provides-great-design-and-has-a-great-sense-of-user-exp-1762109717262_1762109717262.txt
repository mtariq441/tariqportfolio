He will exceed your expectations. Super easy to work with Tariq, incredibly intelligent, and perceptive. He took the fumbled thoughts from my head and turned it all into a beautiful creation. I am very impressed, Tariq is extremely talented and attentive. He delivered exactly what I was looking for based on my very picky taste. I plan on doing business again in the future.

Tariq is an amazing designer, delivered on time and communicated well. I asked for a few revisions after the initial concept and he got updates back to me just 24-hours later. Fully intend to hire again in the future.
